## Hi, I'm Lindsey Tibbitts

I'm an Associate Software Architect in the transportation industry, passionate about building systems that work for both users and developers. With over 14 years in software development, I've evolved from full-stack developer to team lead to architect, always keeping my hands in the code while helping teams work more effectively.

## What I Do

I work at the intersection of technology and human collaboration, helping teams build better software faster. My focus areas include:

- **Front-end Architecture**: Designing scalable React applications and micro-frontend systems
- **DevSecOps**: Implementing tools like Sentry, LogRocket, GitHub Actions, SonarCloud, and LaunchDarkly
- **Team Collaboration**: Bridging technical and non-technical discussions to ensure everyone's on the same page
- **Code Quality**: Advocating for TDD, CI/CD, and practices that speed up development cycles

## My Technical Background

### Core Technologies
- **Primary Stack**: .NET, React, Azure
- **Additional Experience**: Angular, Vue, PHP, Python
- **DevSecOps Tools**: GitHub Actions, Sentry, LogRocket, SonarCloud, LaunchDarkly

### Career Journey
Since 2010, I've worked across the full spectrum of software development:
- **Full-stack Developer** → **Team Lead** → **Associate Software Architect**
- **Industries**: Startups, government, and enterprise environments
- **Focus**: Front-end architectures while maintaining full-stack capabilities

## What Drives Me

### Problem Solving
I love diving into complex production issues and working with teams to brainstorm solutions. There's nothing more satisfying than helping teams ship better software faster.

### Teaching & Mentoring
I'm passionate about helping others grow in their careers. Whether it's mentoring junior developers or teaching firefighting courses, I believe in sharing knowledge and building up the next generation of professionals.

### Continuous Learning
I'm always looking to learn something new. This curiosity drives my blog content and keeps me engaged with emerging technologies and practices.

## Beyond Software

### Emergency Services
I'm an active volunteer firefighter and EMT, bringing the same problem-solving and teamwork skills from emergency response into my software work.

### Teaching
I work part-time teaching for the New York State Office of Fire Prevention and Control (NYS OFPC), developing my skills in instruction and curriculum development.

## What I Write About

My blog covers the intersection of technical architecture and human collaboration:

- **Software Architecture**: From decentralized decision-making to micro-frontend design
- **DevSecOps**: Tools and practices that improve development velocity and code quality
- **Team Leadership**: Building effective collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders
- **Problem Solving**: Real-world challenges and the approaches that work

## My Approach

### Collaboration First
I believe the best solutions come from diverse perspectives. I excel at translating technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders and ensuring everyone has a voice in the solution.

### Practical Problem Solving
I focus on solutions that actually work in production, not just in theory. This means understanding the full context—technical, organizational, and human.

### Quality Through Speed
I advocate for practices like TDD and CI/CD not just for quality, but because they actually speed up development cycles and reduce debugging time.

## Let's Connect

I'm always looking to connect with peers, explore side project opportunities, and find mentors who can help me grow. You can find me on:
