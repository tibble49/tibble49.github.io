## Introduction

Chapter 10 introduces a concept that sits at the intersection of strategy, decision-making, and culture: collectively sourced architectural principles. These principles act as living guideposts that help teams make better decisions—without imposing rigid control or slowing down delivery.

> This post is part of a reflection series based on the book Facilitating Software Architecture by Andrew Harmel-Law. The interpretations, examples, and opinions shared here are my own, inspired by my takeaways from the book.

This chapter shows how principles can help ensure architectural decisions are effective, not just efficient—aligned with your organization’s mission, not just technically sound.

## Key Takeaways

### Why Principles Matter

When organizations lack shared architectural principles, you start to see three telltale symptoms:

1. Duplication of non-differentiating effort
2. Repeated debates over the same architectural questions
3. Technical decisions taking precedence over functional or business ones

Principles help by creating minimal viable alignment—guiding decisions without enforcing hierarchy.

---

### Good vs. Poor Principles

Good architectural principles:

- Are collectively owned
- Tie back to organizational goals
- Are clear, specific, and easy to remember
- Include rationale, implications, and evaluation criteria
- Follow the SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

Poor principles tend to:

- Conflate principles with practices
- Be too generic or disconnected from real architecture
- Lack consequences or evaluative clarity

🛠 Principle vs. Practice Example

- Principle: “APIs should be versioned and backward compatible.”
- Practice: “Use semantic versioning in all RESTful services.”

> The principle explains what outcome matters; the practice explains how you might get there.

### CFRs Say What, Principles Say How

In this framework:

- CFRs define what qualities your system needs (performance, security, availability, etc.)
- Principles define how you intend to design systems that meet those qualities.

You don’t need every principle to apply to every decision. But they should shape the direction your system—and your teams—are heading.

---

### Creating Principles Collaboratively

To make architectural principles stick, teams need to co-create them. The chapter outlines a workshop format for doing just that:

- Start with organizational goals and strategic themes.
- Use a three-theme Venn diagram to visually map focus areas.
- Break teams into working groups to generate and share principles.
- Look for overlap, refine ideas, and vote on the top 15.
- Use the Black Hat thinking technique to evaluate risks and downsides.
- Finalize with group consensus and a shared commitment to adoption.

This process doesn’t just create alignment—it also builds ownership and buy-in.

---

### Keeping Principles Alive

Once established, principles should be:

- Documented one per page, ideally alongside your ADR library.
- Treated as living artifacts, open to refinement and retirement.
- Referenced in ADRs to track usage and identify outdated or unused principles.
- Updated incrementally with added implications, or materially when a principle is replaced.

This two-way relationship between principles and decisions keeps your architecture dynamic and grounded in real-world needs.

## Reflection and Application

> What struck me most in this chapter is the balance it strikes between structure and flexibility. We’ve all seen top-down “principles” that feel abstract or imposed—they sit in a slide deck and never get used.
>
> But a collaboratively sourced set of principles? That’s something that teams can actually carry into daily decision-making. It becomes a shared contract about how we work, not just a checklist.
>
> I also liked the idea of tracking principle usage through ADRs. That’s a practical way to figure out which ones are working, which need updating, and which have simply outlived their usefulness.
>
> This chapter has me thinking about whether we’ve confused practices with principles in my own org—and whether that’s created unnecessary rigidity in some places.

---

## Closing Thoughts

Architectural principles aren’t about control—they’re about shared commitment. When sourced collectively and grounded in organizational goals, they:

- Reduce redundant effort
- Speed up decision-making
- Strengthen alignment without introducing hierarchy

More importantly, they help teams remember why they’re building, not just how.

## What’s Next?

The next chapter introduces another lightweight but powerful tool: the Technology Radar. It helps teams share and evolve thinking about the tools, frameworks, and patterns in use—offering visibility and a gentle push toward alignment without control.

Stay tuned for Chapter 11: Using a Technology Radar, coming soon.
