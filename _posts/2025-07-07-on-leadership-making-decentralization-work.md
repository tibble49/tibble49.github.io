## Introduction

Leadership doesn’t disappear in a decentralized architecture—it just changes shape. Chapter 16 explores what leadership looks like when you’re no longer driving every decision, but still shaping the culture and systems that allow others to do great work.

This post continues my reflection series based on Facilitating Software Architecture by Andrew Harmel-Law. As always, what I share here are my own interpretations and reactions to the material, grounded in my experiences working with distributed teams and collaborative architecture practices.

## Key Takeaways

### Leadership Doesn’t Fade—It Evolves

The myth of “born leaders” or leadership as a top-down, solitary act is hard to shake. But this chapter emphasizes that leadership is work, not a trait—and that work continues before, during, and after decentralization.

Leadership is needed to:

- Establish the social contract and maintain safety
- Encourage participation and inclusion
- Guard against regression into old habits

You can’t outsource this work—it’s the backbone of a healthy, adaptive architecture culture.

### The Role of Transitional Leaders

One of the most interesting ideas here is the concept of “transitional leaders”—those who guide the shift from top-down decision-making to collective ownership.

These leaders aren’t there to dictate. Instead, they:

- Model the advice process
- Encourage distributed authority
- Resist the urge to jump in and fix everything
- Teach new leaders how to think and decide

They make space, offer support, and slowly step back. It’s not passive—it’s intentional facilitation.

### Rethinking Leadership Models

The chapter covers a few models of leadership that align well with decentralized teams:

- Deming’s 14 Points, especially breaking down barriers and driving out fear
- Servant Leadership, with a focus on supporting others rather than exerting control
- Adaptive Leadership, which distinguishes between technical and adaptive challenges and embraces informal authority
- Leader-Leader, where leadership is about intent and shared accountability, not position

These frameworks shift focus away from command-and-control and toward collective responsibility and contextual decision-making.

### Inclusion and Safety Still Matter

Decentralized doesn’t mean “everyone does whatever.” It means people can safely step up, voice dissent, and lead without waiting for permission.

The “intent to” model—stating your plan openly before acting—helps foster transparency and shared awareness without slowing things down. If no one objects, you move forward. If someone sees a risk, it opens the door for dialogue.

This helps distribute leadership and protect psychological safety. Everyone can participate, but no one is forced to. And the system catches potential issues early—without defaulting to vetoes or gatekeeping.

### Moral Leadership and Organizational Habits

Letting go of control isn’t just a tactical move—it’s a moral one. True leadership involves:

- Speaking when values and behaviors don’t align
- Calling out avoidance and inaction
- Structuring systems where no one person is irreplaceable

The goal isn’t heroic individualism—it’s a resilient team that can lead itself. That means rotating roles, documenting decisions, and normalizing shared ownership.

## Reflection

I really appreciated this chapter’s honesty about how hard the transition to decentralized leadership can be. The fears, the regressions, the awkwardness—they’re all normal. What matters is how we respond.

I’ve been in roles where I’ve had to unlearn the instinct to step in and instead help others step up. It’s not easy. But when it works—when someone you’ve coached makes a strong call and owns it—you see the payoff.

This chapter made me rethink where I might still be holding onto control without realizing it. And it reminded me that part of my job as a leader is to create the conditions where leadership can emerge without me.

## What’s Next?

The final chapter, “Fitting the Advice Process Within Your Organization,” brings it all together. It looks at how to navigate your organization’s specific context as you embed the advice process and scale collaborative architectural practices.

Stay tuned for the wrap-up!
