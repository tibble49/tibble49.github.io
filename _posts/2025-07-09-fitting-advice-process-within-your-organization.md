## Introduction

Chapter 17 explores the organizational realities that shape the adoption and sustainability of decentralized architecture. It’s a reminder that culture is more than a backdrop—it’s the medium in which the advice process either flourishes or fails.

This post is part of my ongoing reflection series based on Facilitating Software Architecture by Andrew Harmel-Law. The takeaways shared here are my own interpretations, grounded in both personal experience and reactions to the chapter's insights.

If the advice process is the engine of decentralized architecture, then organizational culture is the terrain it's driving on. And some roads are smoother than others.

## Key Takeaways

### Culture Is the Gatekeeper

How people respond to change depends a lot on the culture they’re working in. Chapter 17 really drives home the point that if senior leaders don’t actively support trust and transparency, decentralized practices just won’t stick.

The culture within software engineering often stands apart from the rest of the organization. Engineers may value experimentation and iteration, while others may seek predictability and hierarchy. These subcultural differences, especially at the “bubble” boundaries, require careful attention.

### Bubbles and Interfaces

The book introduces the idea of “advice bubbles”: distinct groups within the organization that practice the advice process internally. These bubbles can operate differently from the rest of the company—but they still need to interface with it.

To function well, each bubble needs an “interface contract”—an explicit understanding of responsibilities, communication flows, and expectations. These boundaries shouldn’t be ignored; they should be designed.

And sometimes, those bubbles need to divide. The chapter offers warning signs that a bubble has grown too large: trust erosion, delayed decisions, and irrelevant advice forums are all signs it’s time to split.

### Architecture Requires Alignment

Even with multiple bubbles, some artifacts need to remain consistent across the organization. Chapter 17 also makes the case for keeping a single set of architectural principles and one shared tech radar, even if each team applies them differently.

Without that kind of alignment, it’s easy for decisions in one part of the organization to accidentally create roadblocks somewhere else.

### Protecting Culture Through Conscious Design

Cultural divides don’t disappear just because architecture practices change. The advice process might work well inside a bubble but fail when interfacing with hierarchical systems outside of it. We can’t act as if the outside world doesn’t exist.

Thinking of these boundaries as interfaces is a helpful mental model. It creates a frame for asking: what information needs to pass through? What assumptions differ across the divide? What does good collaboration look like?

And like good software interfaces, these human ones should evolve over time.

## Reflection and Application

What I liked most about this chapter is that it doesn’t pretend organizational change is easy. I’ve seen firsthand how even the best-intentioned teams can get stuck when their ways of working bump up against old habits or hierarchical thinking. Having the “right” architectural process isn’t enough on its own—people have to actually understand it, believe in it, and trust it.

The advice to start small—within one team, then expand—is solid. And the reminder to revisit which supporting elements you actually need (versus the ones you think you need) is a good check against unnecessary bureaucracy.

The idea of “bubbles” really made me rethink how to grow decentralized practices without accidentally creating silos. If we don’t pay attention to the interfaces—both technical and cultural—we can end up undermining the very cohesion we’re trying to achieve.

## Closing Thoughts

Chapter 17 brings us full circle: architecture isn’t just about decisions, or processes, or tools—it’s about people, context, and culture. The advice process can scale, but only if we design for scale—through explicit interfaces, consistent principles, and supportive leadership.

You can’t ignore the system you’re in. But you can shape it, one bubble, one boundary, and one well-framed decision at a time.

## What’s Next?

This chapter closes out Facilitating Software Architecture—and with it, this reflection series.

Writing this series has been a meaningful dive into more than just how we make architectural decisions—it’s also about how we build the culture and structures that make good decisions possible.

If the book taught me anything, it’s that architecture isn’t a solo exercise at a whiteboard. It’s a team effort, built on trust, shared understanding, and a commitment to keep learning and adapting together.

Thanks for following along. I hope these reflections have been useful to others walking similar paths.
