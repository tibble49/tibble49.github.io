# 🧪 Testing in Micro Frontends — Building Confidence Across Boundaries

> *Testing in a distributed frontend architecture is as much about boundaries as it is about code. The goal isn’t to test everything everywhere — it’s to test the right things, in the right place.*

---

## ⚠️ Why Testing Gets Complicated

Micro frontends are independently built and deployed. That autonomy makes testing harder — shared routing, events, and APIs mean your boundaries are rarely clean.

Without clear strategy, tests can overlap, drift, or break unexpectedly. Integration points (routing, shared APIs, or custom events) are where most regressions happen.

---

## 🧩 Testing Layers

Testing in micro frontends works best when scoped to clear layers:

- **Unit tests** — small, isolated logic and UI.  
- **Integration tests** — test each MFE’s internal composition.  
- **Contract tests** — validate communication between MFEs.  
- **End-to-end (E2E)** — full system across MFEs.  
- **Visual regression** — catch unintentional style or layout changes.

```
Unit → Integration → Contract → E2E
 ↑        ↑               ↑       ↑
 Fast   Cross-module   Interface   Full system
```

## 🧰 Tools and Strategies

| Type | Example Tools | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Unit | Vitest, Jest, Mocha | Local, fast feedback |
| Integration | React Testing Library, Cypress component tests | Validate rendering + API mocks |
| Contract | Pact, Swagger schema validation | Prevent integration drift |
| E2E | Playwright, Cypress, TestCafe | Test entire composed experience |
| Visual | Chromatic, Percy | Catch styling or layout changes |

---

## 🤝 Contract Testing

Each MFE exposes a **public interface** — routes, custom events, or shared components.  
Consumers define expectations, providers validate them.

Without contract testing, a shared interface could be changed thus breaking another teams application without realizing it

```typescript
// contracts/events.ts
export type CartItemAdded = { id: string; name: string; qty: number; };
export const CART_ITEM_ADDED = 'cart:item:added';
```

Both sides implement testing against this contract and that testing could be run in the CI so the tests fail if breaking 
changes occur, before deployment.

Both MFEs import from a shared contract package (e.g., `@org/contracts`) so schema drift is caught early.

## 🔍 Testing in Isolation vs Integration

| Scope | Pros | Cons |
|-------|------|------|
| **Isolated** | Fast, reliable feedback | Misses integration issues |
| **Integrated** | Validates real interactions | Slower, more brittle |

Balance both:  
- Run isolated tests on every commit.  
- Run integration or E2E tests nightly or pre-release.

---

## 🧪 Shared Mocking & Test Data

Consistency in mocks keeps integration stable:

- Use shared mock libraries or API fixtures.  
- Centralize mock user/product data.  
- Consider a mock API service like **MSW** or **WireMock** for cross-MFE scenarios.

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD Considerations

Each MFE runs its own test suite. A composed staging environment runs cross-MFE integration tests.

- PR builds run fast, isolated tests.  
- Nightly builds verify composed apps.  
- Visual and contract tests ensure brand and interface stability.

---

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls

- Over-testing shared dependencies — brittle and redundant.  
- Only relying on E2E — slow, flaky feedback.  
- Ignoring contracts — leads to broken interfaces in production.

## 🌍 Real-World Patterns

- **Spotify** — squad-level component tests + nightly E2Es.  
- **DAZN** — Pact-style event contracts for MFE boundaries.

## 🧭 Key Takeaways

- Test **at the right boundaries**, not everywhere.  
- Automate contract verification for stability.  
- Share mocks and tokens for consistency.  
- Balance **speed (local)** and **confidence (integrated)**.  
- Treat MFE contracts like APIs — test them as such.

*Testing in micro frontends is less about coverage and more about confidence. The best systems balance autonomy and alignment — so teams can move fast without breaking each other’s work.*
