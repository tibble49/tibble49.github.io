## Introduction

This chapter focuses on one of the most practical tools for modern architecture work: the Architectural Decision Record (ADR). ADRs offer a lightweight, structured, and accessible way to document architectural decisions, share context, and build trust—especially in decentralized teams.

> This post is part of a reflection series based on the book Facilitating Software Architecture by Andrew Harmel-Law. The interpretations, examples, and opinions shared here are my own, inspired by my takeaways from the book.

What I found especially helpful is how ADRs are presented not just as documentation, but as a way to improve confidence—in yourself, in others, and in the decisions your team makes.

## Key Takeaways

### Why ADRs Matter

According to the author, ADRs are the best tool for addressing the three major confidence gaps:

- Confidence in your own ability and the ability of others to make a good decision.
- Confidence in advice seeking and offering.
- Confidence in the knowing everything that is happening, especially over time.

An ADR helps mitigate these concerns by offering clarity, transparency, and structure around each decision.

### What an ADR Is

An Architectural Decision Record:

- Captures a single architectural decision and the surrounding context.
- Is immutable once accepted (but can be superseded later).
- Is structured to make it easy to skim or dive deep, depending on the reader’s need.
- Should be written with future readers in mind, not just for current teams.

---

### Key Components of a Good ADR

- Title – Clear and updated as understanding evolves, until finalized.
- Unique ID – Eliminates ambiguity when referencing decisions.
- Status + Date – Shows when the decision was made or last updated.
- Context – Explains why the decision matters and what the problem is.
- Options – Include 3–5 thoughtful options, avoiding bias and filler drawbacks.
- Advice Received – Include this in raw form—it’s a resource and a reflection tool.
- Decision Outcome – Clearly state the option chosen and why.
- Rejection Is Valid Too – “Do nothing” or reject proposed decisions—still count.

### Writing and Sharing ADRs in Practice

- Start with a brain dump—focus first on the problem, not the solution.
- Get advice on the context, not just the options.
- Advice can help you refine options, uncover blind spots, or split decisions.
- If advice reveals a misunderstanding, clarify the ADR before finalizing.
- Be transparent about who was consulted and why—this builds trust.

---

### Managing ADRs Over Time

- Store them where the work happens—project repos, wikis, or ticketing systems.
- Ensure they’re searchable, backed up, and easily accessible (even read-only).

## Reflection and Application

> What stood out most for me in this chapter was how much value there is in simply writing down and sharing decisions more intentionally.
>
> I’ve noticed that in my organization, architectural decisions often live in Slack threads or conversations that are hard to trace or revisit. While some flavor of the advice process is happening, it’s not structured or documented in a way that’s easy to follow—especially for someone who didn’t witness the original discussion.
>
> I think even a lightweight, markdown-based ADR process would go a long way in helping us create a trail of thinking, validate assumptions, and revisit choices with more clarity.
>
> I also really liked the idea that provisional decisions can focus the discussion. That feels like a healthy way to invite feedback while still moving the process forward. I plan to experiment with that approach in an upcoming decision.

## Closing Thoughts

Architectural Decision Records might sound like a documentation tool—but really, they’re a communication and trust-building tool. They help break down the traditional divide between those who design systems and those who build and run them.

By capturing context, making options visible, and showing who was involved, ADRs support the kind of decentralized, advice-driven architecture practice that this book is advocating.

And maybe most importantly—they help ensure that what we’ve learned doesn’t get lost.

## What’s Next?

With Chapter 7, we enter Part 2 of the book: Nurturing and Evolving Your Culture of Decentralized Trust. The next chapter is titled Replacing Hierarchy with Decentralized Trust, and it shifts the focus from architectural tools and processes to the cultural foundations that support them.

I’m looking forward to reflecting on how organizations can move away from rigid hierarchies and instead build trust-based systems where teams are empowered to act—and architecture becomes a shared, distributed responsibility.

Stay tuned for Chapter 7: Replacing Hierarchy with Decentralized Trust, coming soon.
