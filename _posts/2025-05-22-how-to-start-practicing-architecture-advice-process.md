## Introduction

The previous chapter introduced the Architecture Advice Process as a fast, decentralized, and trust-based way of making architectural decisions. This chapter answers the big question: How do you actually start using this process in your own organization—especially if you don’t hold formal authority?

> This post is part of a reflection series based on the book Facilitating Software Architecture by Andrew Harmel-Law. The interpretations, examples, and opinions shared here are my own, inspired by my takeaways from the book.

What I really appreciated about this chapter is that it meets people where they are. You don’t have to be the Chief Architect or a VP to start making better decisions. You just have to be willing to take ownership, seek advice, and be transparent.

## Key Takeaways

### Adopt the Process as Personal Practice

If you’re in an architectural role, you can model the process yourself:

- Tell people what you’re doing as you do it.
- Ask “why” when people offer opinions without reasons.
- Prepare your thinking, share your options, and explain who you consulted and why.

If you’re in a developer role, you can model the process yourself:

- Seek advice from those traditionally seen as “decision owners.”
- Accept that early adoption might feel like “rubber-stamping” as you build trust.

### Build New Skills, Unlearn Old Habits

- This is a gradual shift, not an overnight change.
- It centers on conversations between equals, not top-down approvals.
- Responsibility and accountability lie with whoever initiates the decision, not a distant authority.
- Trust and learning are the heart of the process.

---

### Common Early Challenges to Watch For

- Failing to explain the process clearly to your team.
- Missing out on key advice contributors.
- Accepting surface-level opinions without asking why.
- Overlooking the shift in accountability to the decision taker.

### Practical Tips for Getting Started

1. **Communicate the Process Clearly**
   - Explain what the process is, how it works, who is involved, and the benefits. Leave space for questions and dialogue.
2. **Involve the Right People (and More, if Needed)**
   - Start small, but don’t be afraid to invite extra people if it helps build confidence and context.
3. **Leverage Experienced Advisors**
   - New decision-makers should seek advice from experienced architects.
4. **Capture What You Learn**
   - Build a shared checklist or directory of who has experience in different areas as you go.
5. **Seek Advice Beyond Your Usual Circle**
   - Don’t fall into the trap of only consulting people you already know.
6. **Push for Clarity**
   - Remind advice-givers that you own the decision and ask “why” to surface the reasoning behind their recommendations.
7. **Stay Transparent**
   - Make it easy for others to see who you consulted and what advice you received. This builds trust and confidence in the process.

## Reflection and Application

> What really stood out to me in this chapter is how approachable this process is, no matter your role. You don’t have to wait for permission to start practicing better decision-making.

## Closing Thoughts

This chapter makes it clear that the Architecture Advice Process isn’t just for people with “Architect” in their title. It’s something anyone can start using to improve decision-making and build trust across teams.

It reminded me that good decisions aren’t made in isolation. They come from conversations, curiosity, and accountability. And like any skill, deciding well takes practice.

## What’s Next?

The next chapter introduces Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)—a practical way to document decisions transparently and build organizational confidence over time.

I’m looking forward to exploring how ADRs can capture the thinking behind decisions, making them visible, understandable, and reusable.

Stay tuned for Chapter 6: Architectural Decision Records, coming soon.
