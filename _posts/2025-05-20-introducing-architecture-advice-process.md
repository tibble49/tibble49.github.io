## Introduction

So far, this book has challenged the traditional ways organizations make architectural decisions—especially in complex, fast-moving environments. This chapter presents a new model for making decentralized decisions quickly, called the Architecture Advice Process.

> This post is part of a reflection series based on the book Facilitating Software Architecture by Andrew Harmel-Law. The interpretations, examples, and opinions shared here are my own, inspired by my takeaways from the book.

At its heart, this process is built on trust, accountability, and the pursuit of informed decisions—not control or permission-seeking. It’s a model I find both exciting and challenging as I reflect on how it could help reduce friction and increase ownership in my organization.

## Key Takeaways

### The Single Rule of the Advice Process

Anyone can take and communicate an architectural decision, as long as they:

- Seek advice from everyone meaningfully affected by the decision.
- Seek advice from experts with relevant experience.

Importantly, this is not about asking for permission. It’s about seeking knowledge, sharing context, and making informed choices. The responsibility for making and implementing the decision rests with the people closest to the work.

---

### Why This Works

- Zero bottlenecks – One person (or team) owns the decision. Nobody has veto power.
- Increased speed – Consensus is not required.
- Better system boundaries – Teams are incentivized to reduce the scope of affected parties.
- Greater ownership – The people making the decision are also the ones implementing it.
- Social trust – Everyone agrees to seek advice when they lead, and offer thoughtful advice when asked.

---

### Who to Seek Advice From

Teams should deliberately consider:

- Who will have extra work because of this decision?
- Whose freedom to act will be limited by this decision?

It’s not about whether the team believes they’ll impact someone—it’s about thinking through the possibility and having the conversation. Even if the advice doesn’t actually change what the team planned to do, just having those conversations helps everyone see the bigger picture and understand who might be affected.

---

### The Difference Between Advice and Opinion

Advice and opinion are not the same:

- Advice includes a recommendation and the reasoning behind it—rooted in experience or evidence.
- Opinion often comes without explanation—a preference without a why.

The chapter calls out how opinions can undermine the process, especially when standardized tools or methods are forced on delivery teams by people not involved in the work. True advice helps inform better decisions. Opinions, without substance, can preserve power structures or stall progress.

---

### Healthy Conversations, Not Power Struggles

The advice process works when conversations are collaborative, not adversarial. There are no winners or losers, just people working together to make better, faster decisions.

### Applying This to My Organization

> Honestly, this really made me think about how decisions tend to go in my organization. A lot of times, they seem to either get stuck waiting for someone’s approval, or they’re pushed through so quickly that the teams affected don’t really have the full picture.
>
> I like that this advice process feels like it could give us a better balance—something that lets teams move faster, but still takes the time to check in with the right people before jumping to action.
>
> I’m also wondering if this could help us close the gap between the teams who recommend tools or standards and the teams who are actually living with those choices every day.
>
> The part about opinion vs. advice really stuck with me, too. It’s made me reflect on how often we hear opinions that aren’t backed up by real experience or reasoning. I’d love to see us get better at asking for advice—and giving it—in a way that actually helps the people making the decision.

## Closing Thoughts

The Architecture Advice Process offers a promising alternative to both slow consensus and top-down decision-making. It’s built on trust, accountability, and shared responsibility, helping teams move faster without sacrificing context or quality.

It challenges us to:

- Seek knowledge, not permission.
- Make decisions close to the work.
- Trust others to do the same.

As we continue to grow and adapt, this process feels like a practical, scalable way to unlock faster, better architectural decisions in a complex, decentralized world.

### What’s Next?

The next chapter takes things a step further by showing how anyone can start applying this approach—regardless of their title or formal authority. It’s not just for architects or leaders. It’s for anyone who wants to help their team make better, faster decisions by building a culture of advice-seeking and trust.

I’m looking forward to digging into this next chapter and sharing my takeaways on how to put this into practice, no matter what role you’re in.

Stay tuned for Chapter 5: The Architecture Advice Process, coming soon.
