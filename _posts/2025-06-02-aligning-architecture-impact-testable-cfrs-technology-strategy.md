## Introduction

Efficiency doesn’t guarantee effectiveness. That’s the core reminder in Chapter 9, which introduces two important tools that help align architectural decisions with organizational goals:

- Testable Cross-Functional Requirements (CFRs)
- Technology Strategy

> This post is part of a reflection series based on the book Facilitating Software Architecture by Andrew Harmel-Law. The interpretations, examples, and opinions shared here are my own, inspired by my takeaways from the book.

This chapter is about steering—not controlling—technology efforts in a way that ensures we’re not just moving quickly, but moving in the right direction.

## Key Takeaways

### Efficiency ≠ Effectiveness

You can make architectural decisions efficiently, but that doesn’t mean they’re the right ones.

- Efficiency is about speed and minimal waste.
- Effectiveness is about delivering impact and outcomes that matter.

This distinction reminds us that architecture isn’t just a technical exercise—it’s a strategic one.

---

### Alignment Isn’t Accidental

Technical alignment is not the result of a grand plan, but the emergent outcome of many individual decisions. Effectiveness comes when:

- Teams are not just aligned with each other,
- But are also aligned with the organization’s mission and goals.

When decisions drift out of alignment, you’ll see:

- Duplication of non-differentiating effort
- Recurring debates over the same issues
- Overemphasis on technical concerns at the cost of business value

---

### The Limits of Imposed Alignment

Many traditional alignment mechanisms—guardrails, shared purpose statements, feedback loops—can feel imposed from the outside. By contrast, the Advice Process and ADRs offer alignment from the inside out:

- They enable shared consciousness across teams.
- They create real-time feedback loops.
- But they still require broader organizational agreement on where we’re going.

---

### Enter: Testable CFRs

Cross-Functional Requirements (CFRs) define the essential qualities a system must have, without prescribing how to achieve them. They create minimal viable agreement for coherent software behavior.

Common CFR subtypes include:

- Performance, Scalability, Availability, Reliability
- Security, Legal, Regulatory, Accessibility
- Usability, Monitorability, Observability
- Cost, Integrability, Extensibility

Good CFRs:

- Are testable—you can verify when they’re met.
- Use well-defined terms to reduce ambiguity.
- Define what to do, not how to do it.

They help teams build components that are independently owned, but mutually predictable.

---

### Technology Strategy as Shared Direction

Where CFRs define the minimums, a Technology Strategy outlines the shared path forward.

It’s not a rigid roadmap—it’s a:

> “Projection based on position and movement.” (Simon Wardley)

A strong strategy:

- Says what we will and won’t do
- Clarifies our defaults and constraints
- Helps teams make independent decisions that still support the org’s goals

It also prevents friction by making boundaries and shared practices explicit—avoiding slow, repeated clarification loops.

---

## Reflection and Application

> This chapter made me reflect on how easy it is to focus on local optimization—building great solutions for one team or system—while accidentally drifting away from what matters at the organizational level.
>
> I’ve seen cases where teams debated endlessly over minor technical choices, while missing bigger alignment gaps. Having clear, testable CFRs would help ground those discussions in shared expectations.
>
> I also appreciate the framing of strategy as projection, not prediction. It’s a helpful reminder that we don’t need all the answers up front—we just need clarity on direction and confidence in motion.

---

## Closing Thoughts

This chapter reinforces that architecture is strategy work. It’s not just about how things fit together technically—it’s about whether the things we build are helping the organization move toward its goals.

By adopting testable CFRs and defining a clear, shared technology strategy, teams can move fast without losing coherence, and make decisions without second-guessing direction.

---

## What’s Next?

The next chapter introduces Collectively Sourced Architectural Principles—and explores how architectural principles can provide guidance on the “how” behind shared agreements like CFRs and strategy. These principles can help bring coherence to decision-making while preserving team autonomy.

Stay tuned for Chapter 10: Collectively Sourced Architectural Principles, coming soon.
