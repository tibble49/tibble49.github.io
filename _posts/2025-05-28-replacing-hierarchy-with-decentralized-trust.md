## Introduction

With Chapter 7, the book shifts from tools and tactics to something more foundational: culture. This chapter kicks off Part 2: Nurturing and Evolving Your Culture of Decentralized Trust, and it examines what it really takes to replace traditional hierarchy with a system grounded in trust.

> This post is part of a reflection series based on the book Facilitating Software Architecture by Andrew Harmel-Law. The interpretations, examples, and opinions shared here are my own, inspired by my takeaways from the book.

What stood out most to me is how intentional this shift has to be. Trust doesn’t just appear. It has to be built, protected, and given space to grow—especially in decentralized environments where shared ownership is the goal.

## Key Takeaways

### Architecture as a Visible, Shared Practice

The chapter introduces the idea of surfacing architecture as a thinking practice, not just a role or deliverable. Done well, this:

- Increases the value of traditional frameworks.
- Mitigates risk by making thought processes visible and reviewable.
- Encourages self-organized adoption of architectural thinking across teams.

This visibility ensures that architectural skills are grown, shared, and impactful, not siloed or hidden.

---

### ADRs + Advice Process = Lightweight Governance

The combination of Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) and the Advice Process offers a scalable way to:

- Track architectural work.
- Encourage responsible decision-making.
- Balance speed and accountability without imposing top-down control.

Even if most decisions still fall to experienced architects early on, this framework helps grow confidence and capability across teams over time.

---

### Trust Needs Structure—But Not Too Much

Trust is fragile. If we over-control, we smother it. If we under-support, it withers. The chapter suggests:

- Some formal elements are necessary (like a decision-making process).
- But these must be minimal, flexible, and designed to support—not replace—trust.

> My favorite framing here is a quote from Edgar Schein: “Culture is the pattern of basic assumptions...a given group has...to cope with its problems.” This is actionable. It reminds us that culture is not abstract—it's how people behave when they solve problems together.

### Why Some Structure Is Still Needed

While early-stage teams may thrive on informality, as the organization grows:

- Cliques form, and informal power structures emerge.
- Influence and access can become unevenly distributed.
- Teams may diverge in ways that slow alignment and delivery.

The solution isn’t rigid control—it’s creating a lean layer of supporting elements:

- A formal decision-making process.
- Information transparency.
- Shared goals and values.
- The leanest set of policies, rules, and approvals necessary to keep speed and agility intact.

> As Patty McCord puts it: “Operate with the leanest possible set of policies, procedures, rules, and approvals—because most of those top-down mandates hamper speed and agility.”

---

### Ask Before You Add Structure

Before introducing a new rule, policy, or tool, ask:

- Is this necessary, or am I reaching for certainty?
- Will it break something that’s already working?
- Am I adding bureaucracy, or helping delivery and learning?

The goal is always the same: maximize the flow of delivering quality software, and learn from the feedback that work generates.

## Reflection and Application

> This chapter hit on something I’ve been thinking about a lot—how to scale architectural thinking without turning it into a bureaucracy.
>
> In my organization, we’ve seen how easy it is to accidentally recreate hierarchy, even while trying to decentralize. The moment trust breaks down—or just doesn’t have enough structure to stand on—people revert to control, escalation, and sign-offs.
>
> I appreciate the reminder that it’s not about removing all structure, but about carefully choosing the structures that support trust, not replace it.
>
> I want to revisit some of the processes we’ve adopted and ask: Are they helping us move faster and more confidently? Or are they just adding friction without real value?

## Closing Thoughts

Replacing hierarchy isn’t about going rule-free. It’s about choosing the lightest, most empowering frameworks possible—so teams can move fast, make informed decisions, and grow trust over time.

This chapter is a call to:

- Make architectural thinking visible and collaborative.
- Use lightweight processes to support accountability and growth.
- Design culture—not just systems—to enable decentralized decision-making.

---

### What’s Next?

The next chapter, An Architecture Advice Forum, introduces one of four optional supporting elements that can help teams optimize and scale the Architecture Advice Process. This particular forum creates a space where teams can bring architectural questions, share decisions in progress, and learn from each other in a lightweight, community-driven way.

I’m looking forward to exploring how this kind of forum could support shared ownership, cross-team visibility, and collective learning in our architecture practices.

Stay tuned for Chapter 8: An Architecture Advice Forum, coming soon.
